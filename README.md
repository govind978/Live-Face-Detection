## Step 5: View Results

1. After running the necessary cells, the Jupyter Notebook will display the input images with bounding boxes around detected faces.

# Working of the Face Detection Model:

The face detection model uses a pre-trained deep learning architecture, typically based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The model is fine-tuned on a dataset containing images with annotated face regions, allowing it to learn to recognize facial features.
When an image is passed through the model, it identifies regions that resemble human faces by analyzing patterns, textures, and shapes.
Bounding boxes are drawn around these detected face regions, highlighting their locations in the image.
The model's performance in detecting faces is highly accurate, making it a valuable tool for various applications, including facial recognition, people counting, and emotion analysis.
